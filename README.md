CljXML Repository
=================

Description
-----------
This repository contains various clojure libraries for working with XML.
The CljXmlLibrary provides macros for building clojure DSLs for any XML
dialect. The other libraries provide at least the DSL for the according
XML dialect.

The CljXML repository now contains the modules (eclipse projects)
 * CljXmlLibrary
 * CljXslLibrary
 * CljXsdLibrary
 * CljXHtmlLibrary
 * CljSvgLibrary
 * CljRdfLibrary
 * CljMathmlLibrary
 * CljFoLibrary
 * CljDocbookLibrary
 * CljBpmnLibrary

The preexisting single module repositories have now been merged into one
multi module repository.

Each of the modules has a separate README file which explains the
modules purpose.

The modules can be built with Baumeister only at the
moment. Baumeister is available at [http://downloads.soulspace.org/Baumeister/]
(http://downloads.soulspace.org/Baumeister/).

If you like to add Leiningen project files, feel free and send me a pull
request.
